            Fulcrum, also known as Damian Luck925, is an American YouTuber and livestreamer hailing from Walnut Creek, California. He made his YouTube debut in late 2019, primarily creating content related to various subjects, including gaming, vlogging, and yes, even his experiences with recreational substances.
        </p>
        <p>
            While Fulcrum explored various content avenues, he gained recognition for his unique and entertaining habit of getting "faded than a ho" in everyday places, such as department stores, fast-food restaurants, and other easily recognizable locations. This distinctive content style began with a video posted on April 28th, 2021, in which he partook in a familiar activity, hitting his blinker, while in a Target store.

            Fulcrum's fearless and humorous approach to creating content, combined with his engaging personality, quickly earned him a dedicated following. His videos not only provided entertainment but also inspired others, including our cheat project team.
        </p>
        <p>
            The creativity and dedication exhibited by Fulcrum in his content motivated us to develop gaming enhancements and cheats that could elevate the gaming experience. We appreciate Fulcrum's contribution to the gaming community and his unique style, which encouraged us to pursue innovative projects.
